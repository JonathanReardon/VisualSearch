**Prototype Visual Search Task**

This is a very basic (and short) visual search task where the user is tasked with finding a particular small symbol on a set of
images. They are free to hover the mouse around the image, and the task is timed. RT results are displayed at the end. 
This was used by Channel 4 as a small "on the road" visual search demo. The code is old and ugly, I'm currently cleaning it up
and refactoring.
